# What is machine learning
Machine learning (ML) is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows computer programs to learn from data and construct decision models without explicitly programming them

The picture above is a comparaison between classical programming and machine learning. In Classical programming, computers can only do what we program them to do. While with machine learning computers can gain knowledge based on previous data.

For example, social media apps use machine learning to create your feed based on your preferences.

There are three types of machine learning:
1. supervised learning
2. unsupervised learning 
3. reinforcement learning

we'll explain each type later
